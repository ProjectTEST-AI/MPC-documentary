# MPC custom language
The programming language for MPC does seem to be a huge roadblock but we have some concepts for now, code it later.

The Mindustry memory cell have somewhat of a weird behaviour where if you inputa number so high it would round up the numbers. based on some testing, we have found the limit before rounding happens, that is:

### `2^53^ or 9 007 199 254 740 992`
