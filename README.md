# Project TEST presents MPC

### MPC an acronym for Mindustry Personal Computer

A (soon to be) fully working computational machine powered by the so called "Logic blocks" inside of the popular open sourced industry & tower defense game named "Mindustry" developed by the almighty Anuken and the community.

Computing machineries inside of games has been pretty popular aspecially to those games with integrated processing mechanic like redstone in Minecraft, Wires in Terraria, to the logic gates in Factorio to which is similar to Mindustry.

As one says, any game with a sufficient integrated processing mechanics can and eventually will have some person or group that will create an advanced computational machinery similar to what the game itself is run on, a Computer.

###### Project TEST created by the one and only **testtm**, Leads to the conclusion that Mindustry has all the required mechanics for such projects, that is specifically the "Logic block", created the project nicknamed MPC.
